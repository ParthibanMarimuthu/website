summary: "Burkov has undertaken a very useful but impossibly hard task in reducing all of machine learning to 100 pages. He succeeds well in choosing the topics--both theory and practice--that will be useful to practitioners, and for the reader who understands that this as the first 100 (or actually 150) pages you will read, not the last, provides a solid introduction to the field."
