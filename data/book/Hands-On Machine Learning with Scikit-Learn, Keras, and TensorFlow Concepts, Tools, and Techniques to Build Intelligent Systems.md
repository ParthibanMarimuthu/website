summary: "So, naturally you are excited about Machine Learning and would love to join the party! Perhaps you would like to give your homemade robot a brain of its own? Make it recognize faces? Or teach it to walk around? Or maybe your company has tons of data (user logs, financial data, production data, machine sensor data, hotline stats, HR reports, etc.)"
